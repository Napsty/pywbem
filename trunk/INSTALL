Installation

PyWBEM can be installed quite easily using the standard Python distutils that
is part of the Python distribution. The source for the installation can be
a copy of the SVN code repository (for example, if you want to get the latest
level of code in development), or a downloaded and unpacked distribution
archive.

From the pywbem/trunk directory of the copy of the SVN code repository, or
from the unpack directory of the downloaded distribution archive, PyWBEM is
installed with the following shell command. The command syntax is shown for
Linux, but this works the same way on Windows and on other operating systems
supported by Python. This copies the PyWBEM source to the Python
site-packages directory where it can be loaded by the interpreter. On Linux,
you need to have root rights:

  # python setup.py install
  running install
  running build
  running build_py
  running install_lib
  copying build/lib/pywbem/cim_xml.py -> /usr/lib/python [...]
  [...]

If you do not have root access, or would like to install PyWBEM in a
different directory, use the --install-lib option when installing:

  $ python setup.py install --install-lib $HOME/python/lib
  running install
  running build
  running build_py
  running install_lib
  creating /home/tpot/python/lib
  creating /home/tpot/python/lib/pywbem
  copying build/lib/pywbem/cim_xml.py -> /home/tpot/python/lib/pywbem
  [...]

Install Python packages PyWBEM depends upon:

* M2Crypto 0.21 or higher, at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/M2Crypto

using your preferred package installationapproach, e.g.:

  # pip install M2Crypto

To test that PyWBEM is sucessfully installed, start up a Python interpreter and
try to import the pywbem module:

  $ python
  Python 2.3.5 (#2, Mar 26 2005, 17:32:32)
  [GCC 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-12)] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> import pywbem
  >>>

If you do not see any error messages after the import command, PyWBEM has been
sucessfully installed.
