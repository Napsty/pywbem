PyWBEM v0.8.0
-------------

This directory contains the distribution archives for PyWBEM v0.8.0.
The NEWS file in each distribution archive describes the changes up to that
point.

This version of PyWBEM is still in development.

The latest development version is the file ending with `-dev.zip`.
That file is regularly updated, so look for its date when you want to
record the exact build iteration.

Earlier development versions end with `-dev.<YYYYMMDD>.zip`).
Yet earlier development versions from when the project was still on
SourceForge, end with `-dev.r<NNN>.zip`.

Please report any issues using the
[PyWBEM issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/pywbem/pywbem/issues).
