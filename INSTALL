Installation of PyWBEM Client
=============================

The PyWBEM Client can be installed quite easily by running its standard Python
setup script (`setup.py`) with the `install` command, or by using `pip install`
(which also invokes the setup script).

As of PyWBEM Client v0.8.0, the setup script has support for installing its
prerequisites. This includes installing the M2Crypto Python package, installing
any prerequisite OS-level packages, and installing or building Swig, if needed.
For details, see the examples, below.

OS-level prerequisites are installed using new setup.py commands 'install_os'
and 'develop_os'. They are supported for a number of well-known Linux
distributions. For other Linux distributions, these commands display the
OS-level packages that are needed. On Linux, these commands use 'sudo', so 
your userid needs to be authorized accordingly.

Installation of the PyWBEM Client is supported into the default system Python,
and (preferrable) into
[virtual Python environments](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).
For details, see the examples, below.

Examples
--------

* Install latest version from PyPI into default system Python (assuming OS-level
  prerequisites are already satisfied):

      sudo pip install pywbem

* Install latest version from PyPI into new Python 2.7 virtual environment
  (assuming OS-level prerequisites are already satisfied):

      mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 pywbem27
      pip install pywbem

* Install from master branch on GitHub into new Python 2.7 virtual environment,
  installing OS-level prerequisites as needed:

      git clone git@github.com:pywbem/pywbem.git pywbem
      cd pywbem/src
      mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 pywbem27
      python setup.py install_os install

* Install from a particular distribution archive on GitHub into new Python 2.7
  virtual environment, installing OS-level prerequisites as needed:

      wget https://github.com/pywbem/pywbem/blob/master/dist/pywbem-0.8.0/pywbem-0.8.0.zip
      unzip pywbem-0.8.0.zip
      cd pywbem-0.8.0/src
      mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 pywbem27
      python setup.py install_os install

The installation of PyWBEM in development mode is supported as well:

      python setup.py develop_os develop

The command syntax above is shown for Linux, but this works the same way on
Windows and on other operating systems supported by Python.

Test of the installation
------------------------

To test that PyWBEM is sucessfully installed, start up a Python interpreter and
try to import the pywbem module:

    python -c "import pywbem"

If you do not see any error messages after the import command, PyWBEM has been
sucessfully installed and its dependencies are available.
