pywbem-0.5  RELEASE-DATE

  API CHANGES:

    * The WBEMConnection.EnumerateInstances() method now returns a
      list of CIMNamedInstance objects instead of a list of
      CIMInstance objects.  WARNING: This is a non-backwards
      compatible change.  Existing scripts that call
      EnumerateInstances() will need to be modified. (Tim Potter)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix parse bug when a CIMInstanceName is passed as the
      localobject parameter to WBEMConnection.InvokeMethod().

    * Fix parsing of INSTANCE elements containing PROPERTY.REFERENCE
      elements bug found by Bart Whiteley.  This turns up when
      processing associations. (Tim Potter)

    * Handle extrinsic method calls that don't return a value or any
      output parameters. (Tim Potter)

    * Fixed parsing of PARAMETER.ARRAY and PARAMETER.REFARRAY to 
      not require optional attrs. (Bart Whiteley)

    * Atomic_to_cim_xml string generation for a datetime - was missing 
      a >> '.' in the string. (Norm Paxton)

    * InvokeMethod did not provide for 'None' in output parameters.
      (Norm Paxton)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Allow a string classname to be passed as the localobject
      parameter to WBEMConnection.InvokeMethod(). (Tim Potter)

    * Add missing qualifiers on array properties. (Bart Whiteley)

    * Added code for performing asynchronous WBEM client operations
      using the Twisted Python framework. (Tim Potter)

    * Allow extrinsic method calls that take parameters. (Tim Potter)

    * Added cim_http.AuthError exception class.  This is raised if the
      CIMOM returns a 401 (Unauthorized).  Now the client can 
      distinguish this condition, and (re)prompt for credentials. 
      (Bart Whiteley)

    * Created cim_obj.CIMParameter class.  Added return type, 
      class origin, propagated to CIMMethod.  CIMParameter object 
      now allows parameter types and qualifiers to be obtained. 
      (Bart Whiteley)

pywbem-0.4  2005-11-15

  BUG FIXES:

    * Correctly calculate value of Content-Length HTTP header to include
      opening XML stanza. (Szalai Ferenc)

    * Fix syntax error when re-raising socket errors. (Pat Knight)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Support for marshaling and unmarshaling CIM dates object into
      Python datetime objects. (Szalai Ferenc)

    * Experimental module for making asynchronous WBEM calls with
      PyWBEM in Twisted Python. (Tim Potter)

    * Add parameter type checking for object location classes. (Tim
      Potter) 

    * Allow caller to pass in a dictionary containing the location of
      the SSL certificate and key files as per the httplib.HTTPSConnection()
      class constructor. (Pat Knight)

  API CHANGES:

    * Change association provider API functions to take a fixed
      parameter for the named object instead of a keyword argument.
      This breaks backward compatibility. (Tim Potter)

    * Remove the CIMLocalNamespacePath class and replaced by a Python
      string. (Tim Potter)

  PORTABILITY:
 
    * Don't use UserDict.DictMixin base class as it only exists in
      Python 2.3 and higher. (Tim Potter)

  TESTS:

    * Add tests for parameter type checking for object location
      classes. (Tim Potter)

    * Add tests for string representation of object location classes.
      (Tim Potter)
