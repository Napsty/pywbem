The PyWBEM Client project provides a WBEM client library and some related
utilities, written in pure Python.

A WBEM client library allows issuing operations to a WBEM server, using
the CIM operations over HTTP (CIM-XML) protocol defined in the DMTF standards
DSP0200 and DSP0201. See http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem for information
about WBEM.

Please see the PyWBEM Client project at https://github.com/pywbem/pywbem for
more details.

PyWBEM is provided under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
version 2.1, or (at your option) any later version. See the pywbem/LICENSE.txt
file.
