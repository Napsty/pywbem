This directory contains the tests for PyWBEM.  You should try and run
them if you are doing development on the code.  (-:

The tests are run by executing:

    # ./runtests.sh

To run the CIM operations test, the test.mof file must be loaded in to
the repository.  Under Pegasus, this done by setting the 
repositoryIsDefaultProvider configuration variable to true.

    # cimconfig -s repositoryIsDefaultInstanceProvider=true -p
    # cimmof < test.mof

Pegasus must be restarted in order for the change to take effect.
