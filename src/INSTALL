Installation

PyWBEM can be installed quite easily using the standard Python distutils that
is part of the Python distribution. The source for the installation can be
a copy of the Git repository (for example, if you want to get the latest
level of code in development), or a downloaded and unpacked distribution
archive.

From the src directory of your local Git repository clone, or from the unpack
directory of the downloaded distribution archive, PyWBEM is installed with the
following shell command. The command syntax is shown for Linux, but this works
the same way on Windows and on other operating systems supported by Python.
This copies the PyWBEM source to the Python site-packages directory where it can
be loaded by the interpreter. On Linux, you need to have root rights, or be
in a virtual Python environment (see virtualenvwrapper Python package):

  # python setup.py install
  running install
  running build
  running build_py
  running install_lib
  copying build/lib/pywbem/cim_xml.py -> /usr/lib/python [...]
  [...]

If you do not have root access, or would like to install PyWBEM in a
different directory, use the --install-lib option when installing:

  $ python setup.py install --install-lib $HOME/python/lib
  running install
  running build
  running build_py
  running install_lib
  creating /home/tpot/python/lib
  creating /home/tpot/python/lib/pywbem
  copying build/lib/pywbem/cim_xml.py -> /home/tpot/python/lib/pywbem
  [...]

Install Python packages PyWBEM depends upon:

* M2Crypto 0.21 or higher

  - On Windows, install M2Crypto from https://github.com/dsoprea/M2CryptoWindows

  - On Linux, use pip: 

    # pip install M2Crypto

  - If the pip based install on Linux fails (e.g. because swig is too old, like
    on RHEL 6.x), install the OS-level package named "m2crypto".

To test that PyWBEM is sucessfully installed, start up a Python interpreter and
try to import the pywbem module:

  $ python
  Python 2.3.5 (#2, Mar 26 2005, 17:32:32)
  [GCC 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-12)] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> import pywbem
  >>>

If you do not see any error messages after the import command, PyWBEM has been
sucessfully installed.
