Installation of PyWBEM
======================

PyWBEM can be installed quite easily by running its standard Python setup
script (`setup.py`) with the `install` command, or by using `pip install` (which
also invokes the setup script).

As of PyWBEM v0.8.0, the setup script automatically installs its dependencies.
This includes installing the M2Crypto package, installing OS-level packages
that are prerequisites for installing M2Crypto, or building and installing
Swig if needed.

The installation of Swig and of OS-level packages is performed using the
`sudo` command, so your userid needs to be authorized accordingly.

Installation of PyWBEM is supported into the default system Python, and
(preferrable) into
[virtual Python environments](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

Examples
--------

* Install latest version from PyPI into default system Python:

      sudo pip install pywbem

* Install latest version from PyPI into new Python 2.7 virtual environment:

      mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 pywbem27
      pip install pywbem

* Install from master branch on GitHub into default system Python:

      git clone git@github.com:pywbem/pywbem.git pywbem
      cd pywbem/src
      sudo python setup.py install

* Install from master branch on GitHub into new Python 2.7 virtual environment:

      git clone git@github.com:pywbem/pywbem.git pywbem
      cd pywbem/src
      mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 pywbem27
      python setup.py install

* Install from a particular distribution archive on GitHub into new Python 2.7
  virtual environment:

      wget https://github.com/pywbem/pywbem/blob/master/dist/pywbem-0.8.0/pywbem-0.8.0-dev.zip
      unzip pywbem-0.8.0-dev.zip
      cd pywbem-0.8.0.dev0/src
      mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 pywbem27
      python setup.py install

The command syntax above is shown for Linux, but this works the same way on
Windows and on other operating systems supported by Python.

Test of the installation
------------------------

To test that PyWBEM is sucessfully installed, start up a Python interpreter and
try to import the pywbem module:

    python -c "import pywbem"

If you do not see any error messages after the import command, PyWBEM has been
sucessfully installed and its dependencies are available.
