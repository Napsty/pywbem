PyWBEM provides a WBEM client library and some related utilities, written in
pure Python.

The WBEM client library allows issuing operations to a WBEM server, using
the CIM operations over HTTP (CIM-XML) protocol defined in the DMTF standards
DSP0200 and DSP0201. See http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem for information
about WBEM.

Please see the PyWBEM project at https://github.com/pywbem/pywbem for
