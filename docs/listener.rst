WBEM listener API
=================

.. # TODO: This description should be moved into the irecv module once
.. #       it is included in this documentation.

The ``irecv`` Python package is a WBEM listener (indication receiver) and is
considered experimental at this point.

At this point, it is not included in the **pywbem** PyPI package, and not
covered in this documentation.

You can get it by accessing the
`irecv directory <https://github.com/pywbem/pywbem/tree/master/irecv>`_
of the PyWBEM Client project on GitHub.
