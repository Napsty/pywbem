PyWBEM provides a WBEM client library and some related utilities, written in
pure Python.

The WBEM client library allows issuing operations to a WBEM server, using
the CIM operations over HTTP (CIM-XML) protocol defined in the DMTF standards
DSP0200 and DSP0201. See http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem for information
about WBEM.

It is licensed under the GNU LGPL v2.

To install the PyWBEM client, download and unpack one of the distribution
archives in the `dist` directory tree and read the `INSTALL` file.

If you want to install the latest development level of code instead, read the
`INSTALL` file in the `src` directory.
