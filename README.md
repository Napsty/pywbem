[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pywbem/pywbem.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pywbem/pywbem)

PyWBEM provides a pure Python package named 'pywbem' that contains a WBEM client
and some related utilities.

A WBEM client allows issuing operations to a WBEM server, using the CIM
operations over HTTP (CIM-XML) protocol defined in the DMTF standards
DSP0200 and DSP0201. See http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem for information
about WBEM. This is used for all kinds of systems management tasks that are
supported by the system running the WBEM server.

The WBEM client in PyWBEM provides a pythonic API. The API documentation is
currently part of the installed Python package, open the file
'pywbem/docs/index.html'. We are working to provide an online version of
the API.
