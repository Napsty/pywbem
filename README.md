The PyWBEM Client project provides a WBEM client library and some related
utilities, written in pure Python.

A WBEM client allows issuing operations to a WBEM server, using the CIM
operations over HTTP (CIM-XML) protocol defined in the DMTF standards
DSP0200 and DSP0201. See http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem for information
about WBEM. This is used for all kinds of systems management tasks that are
supported by the system running the WBEM server.
